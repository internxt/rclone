# {{< icon "fas fa-cloud" >}} Internxt Drive

[Internxt Drive](https://internxt.com) is a zero-knowledge encrypted cloud storage service.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

Internxt uses browser-based authentication. Run `rclone config` and follow the prompts:

```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> internxt
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Internxt Drive
   \ "internxt"
[snip]
Storage> internxt

If your browser doesn't open automatically, visit this URL:
https://drive.internxt.com/login?universalLink=true&redirectUri=...

Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for authentication...

Authentication successful!

Configuration complete.
Options:
- type: internxt
Keep this "internxt" remote?
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Your default web browser will open automatically. Log in to your Internxt account to authorize rclone.

### Headless/Remote Machine Setup

If you're configuring rclone on a remote or headless machine (such as a server or NAS), the Internxt backend requires browser-based authentication.

See the [rclone remote setup documentation](/remote_setup/) for detailed instructions on how to configure remotes on machines without a browser. The documentation covers:

- Using `rclone authorize` to run authorization on a local machine and transfer the token
- SSH tunneling to forward the authentication port
- Copying the config file from a configured machine

### Security Considerations

The authentication process stores your mnemonic and JWT token in the rclone configuration file. It is **strongly recommended** to encrypt your rclone config to protect these sensitive credentials:

```
rclone config password
```

This will prompt you to set a password that encrypts your entire configuration file.

## Usage Examples

```
# List files
rclone ls internxt:

# Copy files to Internxt
rclone copy /local/path internxt:remote/path

# Sync local directory to Internxt
rclone sync /local/path internxt:remote/path

# Mount Internxt Drive as a local filesystem
rclone mount internxt: /path/to/mountpoint

# Check storage usage
rclone about internxt:
```

### Modification times and hashes

The Internxt backend does not support hashes.

Modification times are read from the server but cannot be set. The backend reports `ModTimeNotSupported` precision, so modification times will not be used for sync comparisons.

### Restricted filename characters

The Internxt backend replaces the [default restricted characters
set](/overview/#restricted-characters).
